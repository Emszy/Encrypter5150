# Encrypter5150
A little ruby file encryptor, pass a file and a password, get an encrypted file back. pass the encrypted file and password to the decryptor, get original file back
Probably not practical/storage friendly, just fun to code. Needs more random factors, but it should keep the average bear out of the goodies.
  
  Usage:
    ruby encrypt.rb file PASSWORD
    
    ruby decrypt.rb file PASSWORD
    
  
  
There is an encrypted file already in the repo.
to decode it use:

  ruby decrypt.rb file.encrypted ENCRYPTOMATIC
