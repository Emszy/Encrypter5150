safe to say ive had more dough
had more girls and had more hoes
had more stress and had more trouble
had less fam now we have more doubles

slow hello and with a quick seeya lata
made more decision i had less data
fake friends what could be worse
now i kick back and examine the dirt

keep going in the path of the peers
back to back im just back to my fears
back to the smoke and back to the girls
back to the cash and smacked with world

we burned before its legal
earned before the people
learned it all was lethal
and yearned for more than equals

when it comes to timing, its more than rhyming the beat
its linin the lines up to make the line up complete

skills are of the essence, the thrill of evanescents
we build a cursive message, in hopes you get the sentance

the paragraph coded like a pair of graphs
kinda funny care to laugh
scaredy cat that barely raps
